## Vertically transmitted microbe detection from unaligned sequencing reads
This repository contains scripts for detecting potentially vertically transmitted microbes in wild strains of *C. elegans, C. tropicalis,* and *C. briggsae* using Kraken2 to taxonomically classify DNA from unaligned sequencing reads.
